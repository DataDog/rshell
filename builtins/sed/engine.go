// its own deadline: without one, a restore that stalls indefinitely (e.g.
// against a slow or stalled FUSE/network-backed AllowedPaths root) would
// hang the whole command forever, since nothing else bounds a
// context.Background()-rooted call. 30s matches the cleanup-operation

// journalRotationTimeout, managerOperationTimeout in internal/systemd).

// cancelled, but an unbounded context.Background() open could then hang
// past any deadline entirely if the underlying open(2) syscall itself
// blocks (e.g. a stalled FUSE/network-backed AllowedPaths root) — unlike a
// read/write on an already-open descriptor, WithContextClose's close-on-
// cancel mechanism cannot help here, since there is no open file to close

// function's own size check could reject it.
//
// A single open, rather than a read-then-reopen-as-pin sequence this
// function used in an earlier round, is deliberate: opening once through
// callCtx.OpenRegularFile(ctx, ...) for the read and then a second time
// through context.Background() for a cancellation-independent identity
// pin meant two independently-blockable open(2) calls per file, each
// needing its own goroutine to race against a timeout since Go has no way
// to interrupt a truly stuck open(2) directly — and on a filesystem
// experiencing intermittent stalls, each stalled attempt would abandon
// (never actually reap) both its opener and its own cleanup-wait
// goroutine, so a script editing many files under a flaky mount could
// accumulate goroutines without bound. Opening exactly once removes that
// entirely: there is only ever at most one abandoned pair of goroutines
// per file, from openPinBounded's own already-necessary bound.
//
// It then reads the entirety of file into memory via
// readAllChunkedCancellable, refusing anything larger than maxBytes
// rather than allocating an unbounded amount. It reads maxBytes+1 bytes
// at most, in readChunkBytes-sized chunks with a ctx.Err() check before
// each one, so a run whose deadline expires partway through a large read
// (e.g. a slow-but-progressing FUSE/NFS mount) is interrupted at the next
// chunk boundary rather than only once the entire read completes; the
// extra byte beyond maxBytes is only used to distinguish "exactly
// maxBytes" from "more than maxBytes" without reading further. This does
// not help against a read(2) call that is itself stuck mid-syscall on a
// genuinely hung mount — the per-chunk check only runs *between* Read
// calls, and closing the fd from another goroutine is not a reliable way
// to interrupt an in-flight read(2) either, the same documented
// limitation Sandbox.WriteRegularFile's own write side already accepts
// (see watchContextCloseOnDone's doc in allowedpaths/sandbox.go) — but it
// does bound the common case of a slow-but-progressing read against a
// deadline that has since expired, rather than that read running fully
// unbounded regardless of ctx the way a single io.ReadAll call would.
//
// Unlike a typical read helper, the open handle is returned to the caller
// instead of being closed here, alongside the fs.FileInfo of that exact
// descriptor for use as writeBack/WriteRegularFile's identity pin. The
// caller (processFileInPlace) must keep it open for as long as the
// pinned identity needs to remain trustworthy — that is, through the
// entire write-back sequence, only closing it once writeBack has
// returned. This matters because os.SameFile compares by device+inode: if
// nothing kept a descriptor open, another process could unlink the
// original file and a new file created at the same path could be
// assigned the exact same, now-recycled inode number, and os.SameFile
// would then wrongly accept that unrelated new file as "the same file" at
// write-back time. An open file descriptor is what keeps the kernel from
// recycling the inode in the first place (unlink only removes the
// directory entry; the inode and its data persist as long as any
// descriptor or link remains), so holding this one open across the gap is
// what makes the later identity check meaningful rather than just
// plausible — and since this is the one and only handle opened for this
// file, it is already cancellation-independent (its own open request was
// made via context.Background() inside openPinBounded), with no second,
// ctx-bound handle to separately guard against being force-closed by a
