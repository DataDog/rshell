// Package tee implements the tee builtin command.
//
// tee — read from standard input and write to standard output and files
//
// Usage: tee [OPTION]... [FILE]...
//
// Copy standard input to standard output, making a copy in each FILE
// operand. A FILE operand of "-" is opened as a literal file named "-"
// through the sandbox like any other operand — GNU tee treated "-" as an
// alias for stdout in coreutils 5.3.0 through 8.23, but that behavior was
// removed in 8.24 as mandated by POSIX, and this implementation matches
// current GNU tee rather than the historical behavior.
//
// tee mutates file content, so — like truncate, logrotate, rm, and
// systemctl — it is only available in remediation mode. This is enforced
// both at interpreter dispatch (RemediationOnly) and again inside the
// handler as defence in depth, per docs/RULES.md.
//
// Accepted flags:
//
//	-a, --append
//	    Append to the given FILEs, rather than overwriting them.
//
//	-h, --help
//	    Print usage to stdout and exit 0.
//
// Out of scope (not implemented; rejected as unknown flags):
//
//	-i, --ignore-interrupts   ignore SIGINT — rshell builtins do not
//	                          receive process signals the way a forked
//	                          tee(1) would, so this flag has no
//	                          meaningful effect to implement.
//	-p, --output-error[=MODE] behavior on write error / FIFO-aware
//	                          diagnostics — every FIFO write target is
//	                          already rejected before open (see "File
//	                          access" below), so the "pipe error" modes
//	                          GNU tee -p exists for cannot occur here.
//
// File access:
//
//	Every FILE operand is opened via callCtx.OpenFile with O_WRONLY |
//	O_CREATE, plus O_APPEND (-a) or O_TRUNC (default). This routes through
//	the same AllowedPaths sandbox and remediation-mode gate that backs the
//	shell's own >/>> redirects and the truncate builtin: writes are
//	confined to :rw roots and a multiply linked (hard-linked) regular file
//	is rejected as a write target. A non-regular target (FIFO, socket,
//	device) is rejected by a non-blocking pre-open StatFile check
//	(rejectNonRegularTarget) so the shell does not block waiting for a
//	FIFO reader; see that function's doc comment for the narrow TOCTOU
//	window this leaves and why it is an accepted, low-severity gap shared
//	with the interpreter's own >/>> redirects. See the hard link entry in
//	AGENTS.md/docs/RULES.md for the shared hard-link mechanism.
//
// Exit codes:
//
//	0  Standard input was fully copied to standard output and to every
//	   FILE operand without error.
//	1  Standard input could not be fully read, or at least one FILE
//	   operand could not be opened or written. tee continues copying to
//	   the remaining destinations after a single destination fails,
//	   matching GNU tee, so a failure on one FILE does not stop output to
//	   the others or to standard output.
//
// Memory safety:
//
//	Input is streamed from stdin in fixed-size chunks (teeBufSize, 32
//	KiB) and fanned out to standard output and every open FILE in the same
//	iteration — no buffering proportional to total input size. The read
//	loop checks ctx.Err() before every Read to honour the shell's
//	execution timeout and support graceful cancellation, and also returns
//	as soon as every destination (including standard output) has stopped
//	accepting writes, rather than draining a long-lived or infinite stdin
//	source to no purpose. The number of concurrently open file descriptors
//	is bounded by MaxFileOperands, checked before any FILE is opened, so a
//	glob or repeated operand cannot exhaust the embedding process's
//	descriptor table; a later duplicate name reuses its own file handle
//	rather than reopening (matching GNU tee's write-order and open-once
//	semantics).

// a FIFO with no reader would block the shell indefinitely waiting for a
// connection. callCtx.StatFile is openat-based and never blocks, matching

// and >> redirects.
//
// ENOENT is ignored: O_CREATE will create a regular file for a missing
// target, and any other open failure surfaces from the subsequent OpenFile

//
// This check has a real, if narrow, TOCTOU window: if the target is
// replaced with a FIFO by a concurrent process between this Stat and the
// subsequent OpenFile call, the open can still block — the sandbox's own
// write-open path (allowedpaths.checkWriteTargetLinks) only rejects a
// *regular* file with an excess link count; it does not reject a
// non-regular descriptor post-open the way this comment previously (and
// incorrectly) claimed. Closing this window completely would require a
// sandbox primitive that opens O_NONBLOCK and validates the resulting
// descriptor atomically, the way Sandbox.Truncate already does for its own
// call site; no such primitive is exposed through callCtx today, so this
// pre-open stat is the best available mitigation at the builtin layer. The
// interpreter's own `>`/`>>` redirects have an identical window through the

// new risk introduced by tee; it is an accepted, low-severity gap (it needs
