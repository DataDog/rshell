// TestInPlaceRejectsFIFOTarget is an end-to-end companion to the
// allowedpaths-level TestWriteRegularFileRejectsFIFO* and
// TestOpenRegularRejectsFIFO* tests: it verifies that the full `sed -i`
// command refuses a FIFO target promptly instead of blocking on it.
//
// readAllBounded (engine.go) now opens the source through
// callCtx.OpenRegularFile, which rejects a non-regular target via a
// non-blocking Stat before ever attempting to open it for reading (see
// Sandbox.openRegular) — so the FIFO is rejected at the *read* stage here,
// before any writer would need to be involved at all. A background writer
// that never gets read still has its own blocking O_WRONLY open of the FIFO
// unblocked here (a reader connecting is what a blocking write-open of a
// FIFO waits for, per FIFO semantics — nothing in rshell reads from this
// FIFO once the target is rejected before ever being opened), so the test
// opens and immediately closes the read end itself after the assertions to
// release that goroutine deterministically rather than leaking it.
