// Package meminfo reads host memory and swap usage from the kernel and
// presents it as a normalised cross-platform Info struct.
//
// This package lives under builtins/internal/ and is therefore exempt from
// the builtinAllowedSymbols allowlist check. It may use OS-specific APIs
// freely.
//
// # Sandbox bypass
//
// The Linux backend reads /proc/meminfo via os.Open directly, intentionally
// bypassing the AllowedPaths sandbox (callCtx.OpenFile). The path is a
// kernel-managed pseudo-file that is hardcoded by this package and never
// derived from user-supplied input, so AllowedPaths restrictions do not
// apply. This matches the documented exception used by the ss, ip route,
// and df builtins. No process- or environment-scoped data is read (no PIDs,
// no argv, no environ) — only aggregate, host-wide counters.
//
// # Platform support
//
// Only Linux is supported; macOS and Windows return ErrNotSupported.
//
// macOS has no sysctl(3)-exposed equivalent of the page-level
// active/inactive/wired/free breakdown that GNU free reports: that data is
// only available through the Mach host_statistics64 RPC, which requires
// either cgo or dynamic libSystem symbol resolution (neither of which any
// existing builtin in this repo uses).
//
// Windows' GlobalMemoryStatusEx is easy to call, but it has no equivalent
// of buffers/cache/shared/available in the Linux sense — reporting those
// columns as a literal 0 would read as "this host has no page cache"
// rather than "this field does not exist on this platform", which could
// mislead an agent's memory-pressure diagnosis. Rather than ship a
// half-mapped or ambiguous result, both platforms fail clearly, matching
// the existing "ip route" precedent for commands that read Linux-only
// kernel state.
