// ErrMultiplyLinkedWriteTarget reports a write target that is a hard link,
// i.e. a regular file whose inode carries more than one directory entry.
//
// AllowedPaths containment is path-based: every target is resolved through
// os.Root and a no-follow openat walk, which is sound for symlinks but blind
// to hard links, because a hard link is not a reference to a path — it is a
// second name for the same inode. A pre-existing hard link inside a
// read-write root that points at an inode also named outside every
// configured root would let a write mutate out-of-sandbox content while
// every path check still passes. Since rshell cannot enumerate an inode's
// other names, mutating write targets fail closed when the link count is
// greater than one.

// openWriteFile opens relPath for writing through the no-follow openat walk,
// then rejects the resulting descriptor if it names a multiply linked regular
// file (see checkWriteTargetLinks). Every mutating primitive that
// touches file *content* — Sandbox.Open with a write flag (which backs `>`,
// `>>` and `&>` redirections), Sandbox.Truncate (`truncate`), and
// Sandbox.TruncateToZeroIfAtLeast (`logrotate`) — funnels through here, so the
// guard lives at this single choke point rather than being repeated per
// caller. Sandbox.Remove deliberately does not go through it; see the hard
// link entry in AGENTS.md for why unlinking one of several names is not
// treated as an escape.
//
// O_TRUNC is deliberately withheld from the open syscall and replayed as an
// explicit ftruncate afterwards. open(2) performs the truncation as part of
// the open itself, so an O_TRUNC open (what `>` issues) would already have
// destroyed the shared content by the time a post-open fstat could observe
// the link count — the guard has to run between the two. Splitting them is
// safe because the ftruncate targets the descriptor the open returned, not a
// re-resolved path, so nothing can be swapped in between. For non-regular
// targets the replay is skipped, matching open(2), which ignores O_TRUNC on
// FIFOs and leaves it unspecified for devices.

// The check runs on the fd rather than the path so it cannot be raced: the
// descriptor whose link count is inspected is exactly the descriptor the

// Sandbox.Truncate already uses to reject non-regular targets, and mirrors
// the nlink != 1 skip that internal/systemd's journal vacuum has always
// applied to deletion candidates.
//
// Only regular files are considered. Directories always have a link count of
// at least two (".", plus each subdirectory's ".."), and are never valid

// a second name could alias in the sense this guard protects. Platforms that
