//go:build !with_telemetry

package main

// startTelemetry is a no-op in the default build: spans created inside interp
// register on the global tracer but are never flushed, which is a bounded
// leak acceptable for the lifetime of a short-lived rshell invocation. Build
// with `-tags with_telemetry` to include the real sender (telemetry_on.go).
